Phrase matching
	* Must find all terms in the right order
		$ bin/curl -XGET 127.0.0.1:9200/movies/_search?pretty -d '
				{
					"query": {
						"match_phrase": {		=> match phrase filters for a phrase 
							"title": "star wars"
						}
					}
				}'

				* store the order in which those terms occurs

	* slop
		$ bin/curl -XGET 127.0.0.1:9200/movies/_search?pretty -d '
				{
					"query": {
						"match_phrase": {
							"title": {"query": "star wars", "slop": 1}
						}
					}
				}'
				* slop represents how far you are willing to let a term move to satisfy a phrase (in either direction)
					- so, in this case, "Star Trek Beyond" would match, because we are looking for "star wars" with slop 1
					- it allows as well a reversal of a phrase
						+ so, "star beyond" would match "beyond star" if slop is set to 1

	* Proximity query
		- use a really high slop  if we want to get any documents that contain the words in our phrase, but we want documents that have the words closer together  scored higher
			$ bin/curl -XGET 127.0.0.1:9200/movies/_search?pretty -d '
				{
					"query": {
						"match_phrase": {
							"title": {"query": "star wars", "slop": 100 }
						}
					}
				}'
